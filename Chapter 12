 -    <h1>The Back of the New $20</h1>
 +<div id="entrees">
  
 -    <p>Have you seen the "Series 2004 $20 Notes"? The U.S. Treasury has rolled out yet another revamp of the U.S. twenty dollar bill in an effort to stop those pesky counterfeiters once and for all. It features high-tech fake-busting elements like a watermark,
 -        a security thread, and color-shifting ink. It also features crappy design.</p>
 +<h2>Main courses</h2>
 +<p>Big, bold flavors are the name of the game this summer. Allow us to assist you with finding the perfect wine.</p>
  
 -    <p>I'm not going to concern myself here with a critique of the front of the bill (my friend Jeff says "it looks like something got spilled on it."). It's the <em>back</em> of the note that's driving me crazy.</p>
  
 -    <h2>Too Many 20s</h2>
 +<dl>
  
 +<dt class="newitem">Jerk rotisserie chicken with fried plantains &mdash; <strong>new item!</strong></dt>
 +<dd>Tender chicken slow-roasted on the rotisserie, flavored with spicy and fragrant jerk sauce and served with fried plantains and fresh mango. <strong>Very spicy.</strong> <span class="price">$12.95</span></dd>
  
 -    <p><img src="twenties.gif" width="90" height="140" alt="20s closeup. If you are not seeing this image, check to make sure the file twenty_20s is in the same directory as this document" />
 -        <p>
 -            <p>In particular, it's all those little 20s haphazardly sprinkled in the white space. They are nails-on-a-chalkboard to my visual design senses.</p>
 +<dt>Shrimp sate kebabs with peanut sauce</dt>
 +<dd>Skewers of shrimp marinated in lemongrass, garlic, and fish sauce then grilled to perfection. Served with spicy peanut sauce and jasmine rice. <span class="price">$12.95</span></dd>
  
 -            <p>Are they supposed to be another security feature? ("They'll <em>NEVER</em> be able to duplicate this $20... look at those 20s... they're all <em>OVER</em> the place!") Did they let a summer intern at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing design
 -                it? ("Hey, let Jimmy try it!") Were they concerned the $20 bill might be confused with a $10? ("What this 20 needs is a LOT more 20s.")</p>
 -                <h2 style="color: gray"
 -                Connect-the-Dots</h2>
 -              Connect-The Dots</h2>
 -            <p>There must be more to it. My theory: the new 20s contain subliminal connect-the-dots messages, like tiny constellations. So, perhaps the 20s connect to form a secret message designed to stimulate the economy ("SPEND MORE") or boost patriotism
 -                ("WE'RE NO.1").</p>
 +<dt>Grilled skirt steak with mushroom fricasee</dt>
 +<dd>Flavorful skirt steak marinated in asian flavors grilled as you like it<sup>*</sup>. Served over a blend of sauteed wild mushrooms with a side of blue cheese mashed potatoes. <span class="price">$16.95</span></dd>
 +</dl>
  
 -            <p>I'm not sure I've successfully cracked the code, so I'm asking for your help. I encourage you all to get a new $20 bill, connect the dots to find the message on the back (pencil is best), and mail it to me for review. Together, we can get
 -                to the bottom of this.</p>
